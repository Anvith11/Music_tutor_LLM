    {
        "instruction": "What are passing chords in Nashville numbers?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Passing chords connect two main chords through stepwise motion. Common passing chords: 1-1#°-2m (C-C#°-Dm), 4-4#°-5 (F-F#°-G), 6m-6#°-7° (Am-A#°-B°). These create smooth bass lines and add harmonic interest. They're often diminished or chromatic chords that don't belong to the key but provide melodic connection between stable chords."

    {
        "instruction": "How do you modulate between keys using Nashville numbers?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Modulation techniques using Nashville numbers: 1) Pivot chord modulation (chord functions in both keys), 2) Direct modulation (sudden key change), 3) Sequential modulation (same progression in new key), 4) Circle of fifths modulation (5 of old key becomes 1 of new key). Common pivot chords: 6m in C major = 2m in Bb major. Mark new key clearly: 'Key of F:' to avoid confusion."

    {
        "instruction": "What is the Nashville number for a diminished chord and how is it used?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Diminished chords are written with ° symbol (1°, 2°, etc.). The natural 7° chord is diminished in major keys. Diminished chords often function as passing chords or leading tone chords. For example: 1-1#°-2m creates chromatic bass movement. Fully diminished 7th chords (°7) can substitute for dominant chords and create tension. They're symmetrical, so one shape fits four different functions."
