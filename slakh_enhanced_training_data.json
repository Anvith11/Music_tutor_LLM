        "output": "Acoustic guitars (MIDI 24-25) feature natural resonance, percussive attack, and harmonic overtones from the wooden body. Techniques include fingerpicking, strumming, harmonics, and alternate picking. Electric guitars (MIDI 26-31) offer sustain, distortion capabilities, effects processing, and wider dynamic range. Electric guitar techniques include bending, vibrato, palm muting, tapping, and slide playing. The electric guitar's pickup system allows for amplification and effects that are impossible with acoustic instruments."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Bass instruments (MIDI 32-39) include electric bass, acoustic bass, fingered bass, picked bass, fretless bass, slap bass, synth bass, and upright bass. They provide low frequency foundation, rhythmic pulse, and harmonic support. Bass techniques include slapping, popping, fingerstyle, and pick playing.

        "instruction": "How do professional sample libraries like Native Instruments Komplete work?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Professional sample libraries use multiple velocity layers, round-robin samples, and articulation switching to create realistic instrument sounds. They employ velocity-sensitive samples with crossfading, where different samples trigger based on how hard keys are pressed. Round-robin sampling prevents machine-gun effect by cycling through multiple samples of the same note. Effects like reverb, EQ, and compression are applied during synthesis to enhance realism. These libraries often include thousands of samples per instrument to capture authentic performance nuances."

        "output": "Synthesizers divide into three main categories: Synth Lead (MIDI 80-87) for electronic lead sounds with filter sweeps and modulation; Synth Pad (MIDI 88-95) for sustained textures, atmospheric and ambient sounds; and Synth Effects (MIDI 96-103) for special atmospheric and textural sound design. Lead synths use techniques like filter modulation, LFO effects, and portamento. Pads employ slow attacks, filter sweeps, and heavy reverb. Effects synths focus on sound design and effects processing for unique timbres."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Nashville numbers work with complex arrangements by assigning numbers to each instrument's harmonic role. In a full band: 1 (piano/guitar root), 2m-5-1 (bass progression), drums on rhythm, lead instruments playing melodic content over the chord structure. Each instrument class contributes differently - bass provides harmonic foundation, piano/guitar plays chord voicings, strings add orchestral texture, brass provides harmonic support or melody, woodwinds add color. The number system allows quick transposition and communication across all 34 instrument classes while maintaining each instrument's characteristic role and playing techniques."

        "input": "",
        "output": "String sections (MIDI 48-51) use ensemble techniques like divisi (dividing sections), unison doubling for power, and octave doubling for fullness. Bowing techniques include legato for smooth lines, staccato for short notes, pizzicato for plucked sounds, tremolo for sustained intensity, and sul ponticello/sul tasto for timbral variation. Advanced orchestration involves voice leading between violin, viola, cello, and contrabass, dynamic layering from pianissimo to fortissimo, and specialized techniques like harmonics, double stops, and glissando. Professional string libraries capture these articulations with multiple velocity layers and round-robin sampling."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Instrument selection depends on musical function and frequency range. Bass instruments (32-39) provide foundation below 250Hz. Piano (0-3) and guitars (24-31) cover harmony in midrange. Strings (40-47) add orchestral texture across all ranges. Brass (56-63) provides power and fanfare. Woodwinds (64-79) add melodic color and ornament. Synthesizers (80-103) create modern textures and effects. Voice (52-55) carries melody and lyrics. Percussion (drums, pitched percussion) provides rhythm and accent. Consider each instrument's characteristics: attack type (percussive vs. bowed), sustain capabilities, dynamic range, and technical limitations when assigning musical roles."

    {
        "instruction": "What are the key differences between sample-based and modeling synthesis?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Sample-based synthesis uses recorded audio of real instruments with multiple velocity layers, round-robin samples, and articulation switching for realism. It captures authentic timbres but requires large storage and may lack real-time expression. Physical modeling synthesis calculates instrument behavior mathematically, simulating string tension, air flow, or resonance in real-time. Modeling allows continuous expression and parameter control but may sound less authentic. Professional libraries often combine both: samples for basic tone with modeling for expression like breath control, bow pressure, or string bending. The choice depends on whether you need authentic reproduction or expressive real-time control."
