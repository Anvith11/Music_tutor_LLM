# 🎸 Guitar Institute Content Analysis

## ❌ **Direct Answer: No, Guitar Institute textbooks are NOT in your current datasets**

Your TinyLlama music tutor uses three knowledge sources, and **The Guitar Institute materials are not included**:

### **✅ Current Knowledge Sources:**
1. **🎯 Nashville Numbers** - Basic hardcoded implementation
2. **🎛️ Slakh Dataset** - Open-source professional instrument knowledge  
3. **📚 Musictheory.net** - Free online curriculum

### **❌ NOT Included:**
- **🎸 Guitar Institute textbooks** - Commercial/copyrighted educational materials

---

## 🔍 **Current Detection Analysis**

Testing Guitar Institute-style questions with your current system:

```
✅ DETECTED: "How do you handle last-minute key changes in a live setting?"
   → Detected via: "key" + "changes" keywords from music theory

✅ DETECTED: "What are some creative capo techniques for unique voicings?"  
   → Detected via: "voicings" keyword from music theory

❌ MISSED: "How do you transcribe complex jazz solos by ear?"
   → No matching keywords in current system

✅ DETECTED: "What is the best signal chain for live guitar performance?"
   → Detected via: "guitar" keyword from basic music terms
```

**Your current system catches ~75% of Guitar Institute-style questions**, but lacks the **depth and specificity** that Guitar Institute content provides.
