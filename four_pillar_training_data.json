        "input": "",
        "output": "Last-minute key changes are handled professionally using a combination of Nashville numbers and performance communication techniques. The Nashville system makes transposition instant: if a song is charted as 1-6m-4-5 in the key of C, moving to D major simply means the same numbers apply to D-Bm-G-A. For live communication, use clear hand signals: hold up fingers for the new key (1 finger = C, 2 = D, etc.) and mouth the key name to band members. Practice the 'one, two, ready, new key' countdown technique where you call out the new key on beat 4 before the change. Professional musicians also prepare common transpositions during sound check and maintain eye contact for seamless transitions."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Professional jazz transcription follows a systematic five-step process: 1) Listen for the overall form and identify the key center using interval recognition skills. 2) Identify the chord progression and harmonic rhythm - start with root motion and basic chord qualities. 3) Transcribe the bass line first, then identify specific chord voicings by analyzing the highest and lowest notes of each chord. 4) Focus on characteristic intervals like tritones in dominant chords, and listen for extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths). 5) Notate performance details like voice leading between chords. For complex voicings, isolate each chord by looping short sections, and use your knowledge of common jazz voicings like rootless voicings and upper structure triads. Practice with simpler material first, gradually working up to advanced harmonies."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The 2m7-57-1maj7 progression (ii-V-I in jazz) can be voiced professionally across instruments: For PIANO (MIDI 0-3), use rootless voicings: Dm7 (F-A-C-E), G7 (F-A-B-D), Cmaj7 (E-G-B-D) with smooth voice leading. For GUITAR, try shell voicings on middle strings: Dm7 (D-F-C), G7 (G-B-F), Cmaj7 (C-E-B) or use barre chord variations across the neck. For STRING SECTION (MIDI 48-51), voice lead smoothly: violins take melody notes and extensions, violas handle inner voices, cellos provide bass motion D-G-C. For HORN SECTION (MIDI 56-63), use close harmony with trumpets on top, trombones on bottom, maintaining chord tones and extensions. Professional arrangers consider instrument ranges, avoid muddy low intervals, and use voice leading to create smooth transitions between chords."

        "output": "Professional live guitar signal chains follow these optimization principles: Start with GUITAR → TUNER (always first for mute functionality) → OVERDRIVE/DISTORTION → MODULATION (chorus, phaser) → TIME-BASED EFFECTS (delay, reverb) → AMPLIFIER. Key techniques include: proper impedance matching (high-Z guitar output to high-Z amp input), strategic buffer placement after every 3-4 pedals to maintain signal integrity, and gain staging to prevent clipping. Use quality cables (low capacitance for long runs), implement a noise gate after distortion pedals, and maintain parallel dry signals for clarity. For wireless systems, place the receiver close to the amp and use fresh batteries. Include a backup signal path and practice quick troubleshooting: if no signal, check cables first, then power, then individual pedals. Professional setups also include a dedicated monitor mix for stage volume control."

        "output": "Studio communication with Nashville numbers requires specific professional protocols: Use CHORD CHARTS with rhythmic notation - write numbers above lyrics with slash marks for rhythm (1 / / / | 6m / 4 / | 5 / / /). For complex arrangements, add SECTION LABELS (Verse: 1-6m-4-5, Chorus: 4-1-5-6m) and DYNAMIC MARKINGS using standard notation (f, mf, p). Communicate FORM using Nashville shorthand: V1-C-V2-C-B-C-OUT. For multi-instrument arrangements, specify PARTS: 'guitar plays 1-6m fingerpicked, keys play 4-5 shells, bass walks the roots.' Use MODULATION notation like 'bridge goes to 4 key' (up a fourth). Professional session language includes: 'let's try that chorus with the 6m as a slash chord' (6m/1), 'give me more space on the 4 chord,' and 'let's punch in from the 5.' Always confirm key centers verbally and provide chord charts for all musicians before recording."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Professional real-time harmonic analysis develops through systematic ear training progression: START with interval recognition - practice identifying perfect fourths and fifths (most common in chord progressions), then major/minor thirds. DEVELOP chord quality recognition by practicing major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads in isolation, then in progression context. PRACTICE harmonic rhythm recognition by tapping along to songs while identifying when chords change. For ADVANCED skills, train your ear to identify: bass line movement (root position vs. inversions), chord extensions (hearing the difference between Cmaj7 and C7), and voice leading between chords. Use transcription exercises: start with simple folk songs, progress to pop music, then jazz standards. Practice with familiar songs first - you'll recognize harmonic patterns more easily. Real-time analysis improves by analyzing while listening: predict the next chord based on harmonic function (dominant wants to resolve to tonic), and verify your predictions."

        "instruction": "How do you develop creative capo techniques for unique chord voicings?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Creative capo usage expands chord vocabulary through strategic placement and fingering techniques: STANDARD CAPO POSITIONS create new keys while maintaining familiar shapes - capo 2nd fret allows G-shape chords to sound in A, D-shape in E. PARTIAL CAPO TECHNIQUES use capos that cover only some strings, creating open string drones and altered tunings. Try the 'Shubb capo' on strings 2-5 only, leaving high and low E open for unique voicings. ADVANCED TECHNIQUES include: 'capo arrangements' where you plan specific voicings around capo positions (capo 7th fret for bright, bell-like tones), and using capo to transpose complex fingerpicked patterns that would be difficult in standard position. CREATIVE APPLICATIONS: combine capo with alternate tunings, use two capos for extreme effects, or employ the capo as a creative constraint to force new chord discoveries. Professional arrangers use capo placement to match vocal ranges precisely and create instrument separation in multi-guitar arrangements."

        "instruction": "How do you apply Nashville numbers to modal interchange and borrowed chords?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Modal interchange in Nashville notation uses borrowed chord indicators to show chords from parallel modes: The most common borrowed chord is b7 (from Mixolydian mode), creating progressions like 1-b7-4-1 instead of 1-7°-4-1. Other common borrowed chords include: b6 and b3 from natural minor (1-b6-b7-1 sounds like 'Hey Jude'), and 4m from parallel minor (1-4m-5-1 creates a melancholy sound). NOTATION TECHNIQUES: Use flats to indicate lowered degrees (b7, b6, b3), and 'm' for borrowed minor chords (4m, 1m). For complex modal interchange, specify the source mode: '1-2-b7-1 (Dorian)' or '1-b2-1 (Phrygian)'. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Modal interchange creates sophisticated progressions while maintaining Nashville simplicity - 'Brown Eyed Girl' uses 1-4-1-5-1-4-b7-1, borrowing the b7 from Mixolydian. Professional musicians recognize these patterns instantly and can transpose modal progressions to any key using the Nashville system."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Professional acoustic guitar recording combines microphone selection with strategic placement: Use LARGE-DIAPHRAGM CONDENSERS (Neumann U87, AKG C414) for warm, full sound, or SMALL-DIAPHRAGM CONDENSERS (Neumann KM184, DPA 4011) for detailed, precise capture. PLACEMENT TECHNIQUES: Position the primary mic 6-12 inches from the 12th fret, angled slightly toward the sound hole but not directly over it to avoid boominess. For STEREO RECORDING, use the X-Y technique with two mics crossed at 90 degrees, or spaced pair with one mic at the 12th fret and another at the bridge. ROOM CONSIDERATIONS: Record in acoustically treated spaces with some natural reverb - completely dead rooms make acoustic guitars sound lifeless. Use CLOSE MIKING for intimate sound and DISTANT MIKING for natural room ambience. PROFESSIONAL TECHNIQUES include: recording a DI signal simultaneously for blending options, using a RIBBON MIC (Royer R-121) for vintage warmth, and experimenting with microphone height - lower positions capture more body resonance, higher positions emphasize string clarity."

        "instruction": "How do you develop personal improvisation style while maintaining harmonic structure?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Developing personal improvisation style requires balancing creative expression with harmonic awareness: START with solid harmonic foundation - know the chord progression (use Nashville numbers for quick key changes) and understand chord tones versus tensions. DEVELOP MELODIC VOCABULARY by transcribing solos from diverse artists, then practice incorporating their phrases into your own style. For RHYTHMIC DEVELOPMENT, experiment with displacement - play the same melodic ideas on different beats to create variety. MOTIVIC DEVELOPMENT is crucial: take a simple 2-3 note motif and develop it through the progression using techniques like sequence, inversion, and rhythmic variation. HARMONIC AWARENESS means knowing when to outline chord changes versus when to create tension through non-chord tones. STYLE DEVELOPMENT comes from consistent practice with backing tracks, recording yourself, and analyzing what sounds uniquely 'you.' Professional improvisers combine elements: jazz harmonic sophistication, blues emotional expression, rock rhythmic drive, and classical melodic development. Practice with different genres to expand your vocabulary while maintaining your core musical personality."

        "instruction": "What professional techniques help with smooth voice leading in complex chord progressions?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Professional voice leading creates smooth harmonic motion through strategic note movement: The FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE is to move each voice (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) the shortest distance possible between chords. For COMMON TONE voice leading, hold notes that appear in both chords: C major (C-E-G) to A minor (A-C-E) keeps C and E, only moving G down to A. STEPWISE MOTION is preferred over leaps - when connecting Dm7 (D-F-A-C) to G7 (G-B-D-F), move D down to B, A down to G, keeping F and C as common tones. PROFESSIONAL TECHNIQUES include: contrary motion (voices moving in opposite directions for balance), voice exchange (soprano and bass trading notes), and strategic doubling in four-part harmony. For JAZZ VOICINGS, use rootless progressions that emphasize guide tones (3rd and 7th) while creating smooth melodic lines in upper voices. In INSTRUMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS, consider each instrument's range and blend - strings excel at smooth voice leading due to their sustain, while piano voicings should consider hand positions and finger independence. Practice voice leading exercises daily using simple progressions like ii-V-I in all keys."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Integrating rhythm guitar with Nashville numbers requires matching strumming patterns to harmonic rhythm and musical style: For BASIC PROGRESSIONS like 1-6m-4-5, match your strumming to the harmonic rhythm - if chords change every measure in 4/4, use steady quarter note strums or eighth note patterns. FINGERPICKING PATTERNS work well with ballad progressions: try alternating bass pattern (thumb plays roots on beats 1 and 3, fingers play chord tones on 2 and 4) over Nashville progressions. ADVANCED TECHNIQUES include: palm muting for percussive attack on rock progressions (1-b7-4-1), syncopated strumming for funk/R&B feel, and arpeggiated patterns for folk/country styles. CHORD VOICING SELECTION depends on the progression: use open chords for 1-4-5 progressions in keys like G and C, barre chords for keys like F# and Bb, and partial chords (shell voicings) for jazz progressions. PROFESSIONAL APPROACHES: vary your attack dynamics within the progression, use chord inversions for bass line movement (1-1/3-4-4/5), and employ capo strategically to access optimal voicings. Practice common progressions in multiple positions on the neck to maintain voicing options during live performance."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Professional string section mixing requires understanding both orchestral principles and modern production techniques: For RECORDING, use a combination of close mics on individual players and room mics for natural ambience. MICROPHONE PLACEMENT: position mics 2-3 feet from each section (violins, violas, cellos, bass) to capture section blend while maintaining individual clarity. In the MIX, apply HIGH-PASS FILTERING below 80Hz to remove unnecessary low-end rumble, except for double bass which needs low-frequency content. EQ TECHNIQUES: gentle high-frequency boost around 10-12kHz adds air and presence, slight midrange cut around 400-600Hz reduces muddiness in dense arrangements. For REVERB, use hall-style reverb with pre-delay to place strings in acoustic space - 15-25ms pre-delay prevents reverb from obscuring attack transients. BALANCE considerations: violins typically sit prominent in the mix, violas fill the midrange, cellos provide harmonic foundation, and bass anchors the low end. Professional techniques include: parallel compression for added sustain, stereo imaging with violins left, violas center-left, cellos center-right, bass center, and automation to highlight melodic lines within the section."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Teaching chord recognition effectively combines systematic ear training with Nashville number practical application: START with FUNCTIONAL HEARING - teach students to recognize tonic (home/stable), predominant (departure), and dominant (tension) functions before specific chord names. Use the NASHVILLE SYSTEM as a learning tool: students can identify '1 sounds like home, 5 wants to go somewhere, 4 feels like departure' before learning that C-F-G-C in the key of C. PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES: 1) Play simple 1-5-1 progressions in various keys, 2) Add the 4 chord for 1-4-5-1, 3) Introduce 6m for emotional contrast in 1-6m-4-5. PRACTICAL TECHNIQUES include singing intervals ('do-sol-do' for 1-5-1), using solfege syllables, and playing progressions on piano while students identify numbers. For ADVANCED STUDENTS, introduce modal interchange (1-b7-4-1) and secondary dominants (1-5/5-5-1). ASSESSMENT METHODS: play unknown progressions and have students chart them in Nashville numbers, then verify by playing the progression in different keys. The beauty of this system is TRANSFERABILITY - once students recognize the 1-6m-4-5 pattern, they can identify it in any key and any style, building both theoretical knowledge and practical musical skills."

        "output": "Professional stage presence combines musical competence with authentic audience connection: PREPARATION is fundamental - know your material so well that you can focus on communication rather than technical execution. Practice Nashville number charts until transitions are seamless, allowing attention for audience engagement. PHYSICAL PRESENCE includes confident posture, purposeful movement, and eye contact with the audience. Avoid distracting habits like excessive pedal adjustments or apologizing for mistakes. MUSICAL COMMUNICATION means playing FOR the audience, not just playing music - use dynamics, phrasing, and tempo variations to create emotional journey. RECOVERY SKILLS are crucial: when mistakes happen, continue confidently without breaking character. Professional musicians develop 'mistake recovery' techniques like rhythmic displacement or harmonic substitution to land back on target. AUDIENCE INTERACTION varies by venue and genre: intimate venues allow for conversation, larger venues require broader gestures and stronger energy projection. ENERGY MANAGEMENT throughout the set prevents fatigue - alternate high-energy songs with more relaxed material. Professional development includes studying great performers, video recording your own performances for analysis, and gradually building comfort through smaller venue experience before tackling larger stages."

        "output": "Professional sound check efficiency maximizes limited venue time while ensuring optimal performance sound: PREPARATION begins before arrival - have your input list ready (guitar, vocal, keys, etc.), know your monitor preferences, and bring backup cables/power supplies. SYSTEMATIC APPROACH: 1) Set up equipment quickly and efficiently, 2) Provide line check for each input, 3) Get basic monitor mix, 4) Run through one complete song, 5) Make final adjustments. COMMUNICATION with sound engineer is crucial: use professional terminology ('Can I get more guitar in my monitor?' not 'Turn me up'), request specific frequencies ('Less low-mids in my vocal' rather than 'It sounds muddy'), and remain patient during technical difficulties. MONITOR MIXING priorities: hear yourself clearly, get enough vocal to stay in tune, and have sufficient rhythmic elements (drums, bass) for timing. For GUITAR SETUP, check both clean and affected tones, verify effects pedal operation, and ensure wireless system functionality if applicable. EFFICIENCY TECHNIQUES: pre-set equipment during previous band's breakdown, use DI boxes to speed setup, and designate one band member as sound engineer liaison. Professional musicians also prepare for common problems: bring spare batteries, extra picks, backup instrument cables, and know your signal chain troubleshooting steps."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Advanced Nashville notation can express sophisticated harmonic concepts through extended notation systems: CHORD EXTENSIONS use standard notation: 17 (major 7th), 1maj7 (major 7th), 19 (add 9), 1maj9 (major 9th). ALTERED DOMINANTS employ specific symbols: 5alt (altered dominant with b9, #9, #11, b13), 5b9, 5#11. SLASH CHORDS indicate specific bass notes: 1/3 (first inversion), 4/5 (subdominant over dominant), 6m/4 (relative minor over subdominant). MODAL INTERCHANGE uses borrowed chord indicators: b7 (borrowed from Mixolydian), b6 (from Aeolian), 4m (minor iv from parallel minor). SECONDARY DOMINANTS employ the 'of' notation: 5/5 (five of five - V/V), 5/6m (five of six minor). For COMPLEX PROGRESSIONS like jazz standards, advanced Nashville might read: 1maj7-6m7-2m7-5alt-1maj7-3m7b5-6m7. ENHARMONIC RELATIONSHIPS are handled by context: #4° = b5 depending on harmonic function. Professional musicians develop personal shorthand for complex harmonies while maintaining communication clarity.

Apply MUSIC THEORY for voice leading: ensure smooth motion between chords, use proper doubling rules, and understand harmonic function. INSTRUMENT KNOWLEDGE from the Slakh dataset informs part writing: strings (MIDI 48-51) excel at sustained harmonies and melodic lines, brass (MIDI 56-63) provides powerful punctuation and fanfares, woodwinds (MIDI 64-79) add color and melodic interest. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS include: dynamic range planning (soft verse, powerful chorus), texture variation (thin verse, thick chorus), and instrumental capabilities (guitar voicings across the neck, piano hand positions). PRACTICAL PROCESS: 1) Establish form and harmonic rhythm, 2) Assign melodic responsibilities (lead vocal, instrumental solos), 3) Create harmonic foundation (bass line, chord rhythm), 4) Add supporting parts (harmony vocals, instrumental fills), 5) Consider production elements (effects, dynamics).

ELECTRIC GUITAR AMPLIFIERS require dynamic mics (Shure SM57) close to the speaker cone, with ribbon mics (Royer R-121) adding warmth when blended. PIANO recording benefits from stereo pairs: condensers over the strings (spaced or X-Y configuration), with additional mics for specific techniques - close mics for percussive attack, room mics for natural ambience. BRASS INSTRUMENTS (trumpet, trombone, saxophone) use dynamic mics positioned 6-12 inches from the bell, with condensers for ensemble recording. STRING SECTIONS require multiple approaches: individual close mics for each section plus room mics for natural blend. DRUMS demand comprehensive mic setup: dynamic mics for drums (kick, snare, toms), condensers for cymbals and overheads. VOCAL RECORDING typically uses large-diaphragm condensers with pop filters, positioned 6-8 inches from the performer.
